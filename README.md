# Flaire App

In this app, my focus was on maintaining code quality and simplicity.

Since the mock API returns a single list of items, I chose to handle pagination directly within the state. To enhance reusability, I used a custom React hook.

The app could be further improved by integrating state management libraries like Zustand or Redux, and by optimizing data fetching with tools like SWR or React Query.

Additionally, rendering performance could be enhanced with techniques like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™d consider adding user analytics tools such as Mixpanel to gain insights into user behavior. Another enhancement could be a more robust error-handling system, including logging errors to external services like Sentry for better tracking and debugging.
